# waiter-order-taking-mobile-app
# Introduction
This innovative Android application, developed using Kotlin in Android Studio, is designed specifically to assist waiters in managing customer orders more efficiently within a restaurant setting. The app simplifies the order-taking process by allowing waiters to select a specific table and record the customers’ orders in a designated section of the interface. From there, waiters can manage these orders seamlessly—editing or deleting notes as necessary—ensuring that all customer requests are accurately tracked.

One of the app’s standout features is its ability to display all table orders sorted by the time they were submitted, with the earliest (or longest pending) orders appearing first. This feature allows waiters to prioritize and handle tasks more effectively, ensuring that no orders are overlooked or delayed. To further enhance service efficiency, the app has a built-in notification system that alerts the waiter if an order has been pending for more than 30 minutes. The notification, "Order time exceeded for table (table number)," helps the waitstaff stay on top of their responsibilities and provide timely service.

The application also streamlines the user authentication process. Waiters and other users of the app can sign up and log in once, without the need to repeatedly enter their login credentials for subsequent sessions. This reduces friction and ensures a faster, more efficient user experience, allowing the staff to focus more on customer service rather than dealing with app-related overhead.

In summary, this app provides a comprehensive solution for restaurants to enhance their order management processes. It empowers waiters to handle tasks swiftly and accurately, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures timely service, all while providing an easy-to-use interface for users. The combination of table-based order tracking, timed notifications, and a one-time login system makes this app a valuable tool for any restaurant looking to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
